# ShmupCC
ShmupCC is (planned to be) an open-source STG engine. Unfortunately, it's extremely early in development, so currently a lot of mechanics are not implemented yet, like a failure state, enemies, or even sound.



# Features (as of current version minus1.00)
-move your placeholder asset ship in focused and unfocused speeds!

-explore exciting menu options, such as "exit game" and "this does absolutely nothing"

# Can I use this engine to make my own STGs?
Feel free to use this however you wish - but I'd prefer that it not be used to make paid games. Also, in its current state, you'd need to essentially build half of the engine on your own.

# Can I help work on this?
Go ahead! If you coded a feature you think should be included in the distributable version of this, send the source code to me and I'll check it out and possibly add it.

# How can I contact you?
My discord username is The First Letter of the Alphabet#5160, and I usually do most of my work on this engine while chatting in the ZUNcode server.
