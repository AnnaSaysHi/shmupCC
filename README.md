# ShmupCC
ShmupCC is (planned to be) an open-source STG engine. Unfortunately, it's somewhat early in development, so currently a lot of mechanics are not implemented yet, like dialogue or multiple shot types.



# Features (as of current version 1.1.0)
-Move your placeholder asset ship and shoot placeholder asset enemies!

-Explode on touching a bullet!

-Fool around with flashbombs from the Len'en series!

-Play with several wonderful settings in the options menu!

-Alter Script1_4 to make funny patterns!

# Help! My input breaks randomly!
If this happens and you're running on Macbook, it may be because your keyboard is attempting to open the accent menu. Try opening up terminal and running ``defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false``. If the problem persists, then it's beyond me.

# Can I use this engine to make my own STGs?
Feel free to use this however you wish - but I'd prefer that it not be used to make paid games. Also, some basic features haven't been properly implemented yet. That said, if you want to make scripts or otherwise contribute to this engine's development, join the discord server below and @ me - I'll try to explain how to work with this engine.

# Can I help work on this?
Go ahead! If you want to work on this project, join the discord server at https://discord.gg/Z6PKKCab2b or message me.

# How can I contact you?
My discord username is anna_says_hi_, and I usually do most of my work on this engine while chatting in the ZUNcode server.
