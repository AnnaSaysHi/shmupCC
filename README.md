# ShmupCC
ShmupCC is (planned to be) an open-source STG engine. Unfortunately, it's extremely early in development, so currently a lot of mechanics are not implemented yet, like a menu system, enemies, or even sound.



# Features (as of current version minus2.02)
none lol

# Can I use this engine to make my own STGs?
Feel free to use this however you wish - but I'd prefer that it not be used to make paid games.
