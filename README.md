# ShmupCC
ShmupCC is (planned to be) an open-source STG engine. Unfortunately, it's somewhat early in development, so currently a lot of mechanics are not implemented yet, like bosses or multiple shot types.



# Features (as of current version 1.0.2)
-Move your placeholder asset ship and shoot placeholder asset enemies!

-Explode on touching a bullet!

-Choose from several different test patterns!

-Use a hex editor (not included) to adjust your shot's properties!

# Can I use this engine to make my own STGs?
Feel free to use this however you wish - but I'd prefer that it not be used to make paid games. Also, some basic features haven't been properly implemented yet. That said, if you want to make scripts for this engine, join the discord server below and @ me - I'll try to explain how to script in this engine.

# Can I help work on this?
Go ahead! If you want to work on this project, join the discord server at https://discord.gg/Z6PKKCab2b or message me.

# How can I contact you?
My discord username is anna_says_hi_, and I usually do most of my work on this engine while chatting in the ZUNcode server.
