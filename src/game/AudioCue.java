/**
 * The {@code AudioCue} class functions as a data line, where the
 * audio data played directly from memory. {@code AudioCue} is modeled 
 * upon {@code javax.sound.sampled.Clip} but with additional capabilities.
 * It can play multiple instances concurrently, and offers individual
 * dynamic controls for volume, panning and speed for each concurrently 
 * playing instance.
 * <p>
 * An {@code AudioCue} is created using the static factory method
 * {@code makeAudioCue}. When doing so, the media data is loaded 
 * either from a "CD Quality" wav file (44100 fps, 16-bit, stereo, 
 * little-endian) or a float array of stereo PCM normalized to the 
 * range -1 to 1, at 44100 fps. Once loaded, the media data is 
 * immutable.
 * <p>
 * {@code AudioCue} achieves concurrent playback by treating state at
 * two levels. A distinction is made between the {@code AudioCue} 
 * which holds the audio data, and a playback <em>instance</em> which
 * controls a cursor that traverses over that data and corresponds to
 * a single sounding playback. Methods that dynamically affect
 * playback (volume, pan, speed) operate at the instance level. When 
 * using the factory method to create an {@code AudioCue}, the
 * maximum number of simultaneously playing instances to be supported
 * is set, along with the data source.
 * <p>
 * An {@code AudioCue} is either open or closed. Upon opening, an
 * output line is obtained from the system. That line will either be
 * held directly by the {@code AudioCue} or provided indirectly by an
 * {@code AudioMixer}, in which case 'opening' refers to the act
 * of registering as an {@code AudioMixerTrack} with an 
 * {@code AudioMixer}. Upon closing, the {@code AudioCue} releases the
 * system audio line, or if registered with an {@code AudioMixer}, 
 * unregisters. Opening and closing events are broadcast to registered
 * listeners implementing the methods
 * {@code AudioCueListener.audioCueOpened} and
 * {@code AudioCueListener.audioCueClosed}.
 * <p>
 * The line used for output is a 
 * {@code javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine}. The format specified
 * for the line is 44100 fps, 16-bit, stereo, little-endian, a format
 * also known as "CD Quality". This format is one of the most widely
 * supported and is the only format available for output via 
 * {@code AudioCue}. If a {@code javax.sound.sampled.Mixer} is not
 * specified, the default behavior is to obtain the line from the
 * system's default {@code Mixer}, with a buffer size of 1024 frames
 * (4192 bytes). The line will be run from within a dedicated thread,
 * with a thread priority of {@code HIGHEST}. Given that the 
 * processing of audio data usually progresses much faster than time
 * it takes to play the media, this thread can be expected to spend
 * most of its time in a blocked state, which allows maximizing the
 * thread priority without impacting overall performance. An 
 * alternative {@code Mixer}, buffer length or thread priority can be
 * specified as parameters to the {@code open} method. 
 * <p>
 * An <em>instance</em> can either be <em>active</em> or not active,
 * and, if active, can either be <em>running</em> or not running. 
 * Instances are initially held in a pool as 'available instances'.
 * An instance becomes active when it is removed from that pool. 
 * Methods which remove an instance from the pool either return an
 * {@code int} identifier or -1 if there are no available instances.
 * An active instance can receive commands pertaining to the cursor's
 * location in the audio data, to starting or stopping, as well as
 * volume, pan, and speed changes, and other commands. An inactive
 * instance can only receive a command that withdraws it from the 
 * 'available instances' pool. An instance that is <em>running</em>
 * is one that is currently being played.
 * <p>
 * Each instance holds its own state variables for volume, pan and
 * speed, cursor location, and looping. Methods are provided for
 * changing these values. If the methods are called while the 
 * instance is not running, the new value is stored immediately and 
 * will take affect when the instance is restarted. If the instance
 * is running, and the change is for volume, pan, or speed, the new 
 * value will be arrived at incrementally, with the increments 
 * occurring behind the scenes on a per frame basis. This is done to
 * prevent discontinuities in the signal that might result in audible
 * clicks. If a running instance's property is updated before the 
 * incremental changes have completed, the new target value takes 
 * precedence, and a new increment is created based on the current,
 * in-progress value.
 * <p>
 * An instance may be played on a <em>fire-and-forget</em> basis, in 
 * which case it is automatically returned to the pool of available
 * instances (active == false). Alternatively, the instance can be
 * allowed to stay active upon completion. The behavior upon play 
 * completion is controlled by the public method 
 * {@code setRecycleWhenDone(int, boolean)}, where {@code int} is the
 * instance identifier. When a {@code play} method is called, the 
 * {@code recycledWhenDone} value is set to {@code true} by default.
 * When {@code obtainInstance} is used, the {@code recycledWhenDone}
 * value is set to {@code false}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Examples</strong>: (assumes the audioCue is open) 
 * <pre><code>    // (1) Fire-and-Forget, with default values.
 *    audioCue.play(); // (vol = 1, pan = 0, speed = 1, loop = 0)
 *    // instance will be recycled upon completion.
 *    
 *    // (2) Fire-and-forget, with explicit values
 *    int play0 = audioCue.play(0.5, -0.75, 2, 1); 
 *    // will play at "half" volume, "half way" to the left pan,
 *    // double the speed, and will loop back and play again one time.
 *    // Instance will be recycled upon completion, however, the
 *    // play0 variable allows one to make further changes to the
 *    // instance if executed prior to the completion of the 
 *    // playback.
 *    
 *    // (3) Using obtainInstance()
 *    int footstep = footstepCue.obtainInstance();
 *    for (int i = 0; i &#60; 10; i++) {
 *        // play the successive footsteps more quietly
 *        footstepCue.setVolume(footstep, 1 - (i * 0.1));
 *        // successive footsteps will travel from left to right
 *        footstepCue.setPan(footstep, -1 + (i * 0.2));
 *        // cursor must be manually placed at the beginning
 *        footstepCue.setFramePosition(footstep, 0);
 *        footstepCue.start(footstep);
 *        Thread.sleep(1000); // Allow time between each footstep start.
 *        // This assumes that the cue is shorter than 1 second in 
 *        // in length and each start will stop on its own.
 *    }
 *    // Another instance might be associated with a slightly 
 *    // different speed, for example 1.1, implying a different 
 *    // individual with a slightly lighter foot fall.
 *    </code></pre>
