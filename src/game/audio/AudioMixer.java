/**
 * An {@code AudioMixer} mixes the media content of all the members  
 * of a {@code AudioMixerTrack} collection into a single output
 * line. Classes implementing {@code AudioMixerTrack} can be added 
 * and removed from the mix asynchronously, with the operation 
 * occurring at the next iteration of the read buffer. Unlike a 
 * mixer used in sound studios, the {@code AudioMixer} does not 
 * provide functions such as panning or volume controls. 
 * <p>
 * An {@code SourceDataLine} can be in one of two states: (1) running, 
 * or (2) not running. When running, audio data is read from the 
 * constituent tracks, mixed and written as a single stream using a
 * {@code javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine}. The mixer imposes a 
 * simple floor/ceiling of -1, 1, to guard against volume overflows.
 * When not running, the {@code SourceDataLine} is allowed to drain 
 * and close. A new {@code SourceDataLine} is instantiated if/when 
 * this {@code AudioMixer} is reopened.
 * <p>
 * Values used to configure the media output are provided in the 
 * constructor, and are held as immutable. These include a 
 * {@code javax.sound.sampled.Mixer} used to provide the 
 * {@code SourceDataLine}, the size of the buffer used for iterative
 * reads of the PCM data, and the thread priority. Multiple constructors
 * are provided to facilitate the use of default values. These
 * configuration values override those associated with the constituent
 * tracks.
