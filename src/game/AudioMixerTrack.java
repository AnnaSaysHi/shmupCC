/**
 * An interface for classes that make audio data available to an 
 * {@code AudioMixer} for media play via the {@code read} method.
 * <p>
 * Objects that implement {@code AudioMixerTrack} can either be (1) running, 
 * or (2) not running. There are no explicit restrictions related to the 
 * relationship between the state and the read method. Nor are there any 
 * restrictions or promises made as to the content of the returned float 
 * array. 
 * <p>
 * However, in this package, the following conditions have been implemented:
 * <ul><li>The {@code read} method will only be executed after the track is
 * first shown to be in a running state;</li>
 * <li>the read array is expected to consist of signed, normalized floats of 
 * stereo PCM encoded at 44100 frames
 * per second.</li></ul>
 * <p>
 * With these constraints in place, the media write of audio from the track
 * can in effect be muted by setting the state to not running, and the media 
 * writes can be set to resume by setting the state to running.
 * 
 * @since 2.0.0
 * @version 2.1.0
