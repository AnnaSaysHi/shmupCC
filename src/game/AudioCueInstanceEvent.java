/**
 * Represents an event in the life cycle of an {@code AudioCue} play
 * back instance and is passed as an argument to objects that implement
 * the {@code AudioCueListener} interface and are registered to listen.
 * <p>
 * {@code AudioCue} supports concurrent media writes by managing
 * a pool of instances. The lifecycle of an instance is as
 * follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>OBTAIN_INSTANCE: an instance is obtained from the pool
 * of available instances if the limit of concurrent instances 
 * is not exceeded</li> 
 * <li>START_INSTANCE: an instance starts to play</li> 
 * <li>LOOP: a instance that finishes playing restarts from the 	
 * beginning</li>
 * <li>STOP_INSTANCE: a playing instance is stopped (but can
 * be restarted)</li>
 * <li>RELEASE_INSTANCE: an instance is released back into the 
 * pool of available instances.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An {@code AudioCueInstanceEvent} holds following immutable fields:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>type</strong> - an {@code enum}, 
 * {@code AudioCueInstanceEvent.Type} designating the event</li>
 * <li><strong>time</strong> - a {@code long} containing the time 
 * of occurrence of the event, to the nearest millisecond</li>
 * <li><strong>source</strong> - the parent {@code AudioCue}</li>
 * <li><strong>frame</strong> - a {@code double} containing the frame 
 * (may be a fractional value) that was current at the time of the event</li>
 * <li><strong>instanceID</strong> - an {@code int} used to identify the 
 * {@code AudioCue} play back instance.</li></ul>
